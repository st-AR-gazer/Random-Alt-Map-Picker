Initial release

0.1.1 -
Added an export "GetARandomAltMapUid" that when called, surprisingly returns a random map UID string. :) Will add some more in the future if it's possible :)

What has changed? Everything, (minus loading map from UID), here are the three major ones.

1. You can now sort anything based on the Alteration, season/year, as well as the medal times.
2. The UI is massively improved, open it through the Plugins tab
3. Massively improved exports, other plugins can now set/get/change the settings/current map to load/settings whenever.

3.3.0 -
New API update
Functions are new in the AN namespace, so you need to call them with AN:: before the function name.

New profiles
You can now save/crate, load and delete profiles to save your settings for later use, the current settings are automatically saved,
but if you only want specific alterations to be enabled by the press of a button, you can now do that.
Perfect for trolling a unsuspecting Lars.

Minor bugfixes
Fixed a bug where you could not load maps from specfiic alterations...
